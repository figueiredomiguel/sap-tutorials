# Hi there üëãüèº
I'm currently Customer Success Partner at SAP.

I am a customer success partner at SAP with the purpose, through the use of good technologies, to help companies work better in order to carry out their digital transformation in addition to improving the management of the experience, so that they can establish better relations with their brands, customers, employees and business partners aiming to grow in results.

Throughout my journey that started in 1992, a lot of technology was created and adopted by countless companies that I was happily able to serve. For approximately 8 years focused on application development and noting the importance that data represented in driving the company's strategy, in 2000 I decided to make a move towards the world of databases.

From there, there were many technologies that I worked with in a scenario of many acquisitions of technology companies. Interestingly, I worked at Sybase and Business Objects, companies that were acquired by SAP, where I work since 2007.

Despite the technical background, I consider myself a salesman, always connected in some way to technical and commercial sales. This movement became stronger from 2009, when I started the Business Intelligence Regional Practice. In 2012, I put into practice what was intended for my career and with the autonomy I needed joing the SAP sales team.

Today I dedicate myself wholeheartedly to my role, where I try to help companies of various sizes and from the most varied segments in their journey of transformation.

The world has changed and we live in an era of very interesting technologies that enable companies to become more intelligent, making better usage of data and how manage the experience in relationships, making these corporations truly exponential. You can't get different results by doing the way we do. Therefore, it is necessary to review situations and often think outside the box.

Even having an MBA degree from Mackenzie University, and always being involved in business training around the world, I needed more time focused on studies from an external perspective to the companies I spent, and then I decided to do the Executive MBA International at FIA with international modules at EM Lyon Business School in France, Cambridge University in England, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing (Tongji and Lingnan University) at Vanderbilt University (Nashville).

And even running this very intense life that we live, I still manage to be Alessandra's husband and the father of Beatriz and Ethan, which I am super grateful for being part of my journey and being the real purpose in my life.
